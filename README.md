# DreamCube Boilerplate Project

This program known as the _Pitch_ is the main software component needed to run for the _DreamCube's_ interactive virtual reality room. The main attraction is an arcade-style ball game using a physical ball tracked in three-dimensions. This repo contains two simple example scenes for modes of interaction.

This project relies on [dreamcube.pitch-app-core](https://github.com/local-projects/dreamcube.pitch-app-core.unity) repo as a submodule.
Fork this repo and build a new DreamCube experience.

**WARNING: DO NOT make changes to any of the Base Scenes, or Main scene.   
Those are critical for running your project in the DreamCube**

<!-- Installation -->

## Installation

1. Fork the repo
2. Rename the repo (To your project name)
3. Clone your fork `git clone [your forks name]`
4. Load the core submodule `git submodule --init --recursive`
5. Set the configuration file:

An external settings file is required. It's located at `StreamingAssets\general_config.json`.
If the file does not exist it will be created using the default values at first run.

`DreamCube` - Name of assigned DreamCube <br />
`Debug` - Whether the app is in debug mode <br />
`RTLSLocalIP` - IP of the computer's NIC running this software to which you want to bind RTLS <br />
`RTLSRemoteIP` - IP of the RTLS Server <br />
`RTLSPort` - Port of the RTLS <br />
`UseASIO`- Audio output to the DSP <br />
`ASIODriverIndex`- Audio output Index <br />
`AsioAutoDetectName` - Audio output name <br />
`DSPBufferLength` - DSP Buffer length <br />
`DSPBufferCount` - DSP Buffer Count <br />


```

```

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage in Development

1. Open the project with [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). It will prompt you to download the correct version of the Unity editor.  
   
2. Open Assets/_DemoApp/Scenes/Main  
   
3. Switch game view to Display 5 or 6  
    
4. Hit play and click on the game view to kick the ball  
   
5. Build the project according to [Unity's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).


<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

_The program does not show on the correct displays._<br />
In the Windows or GPU display manager, the displays should be tiled left to right with indices 1-4. Display 1 should set to the `primary screen`.

For more detail, you should refer to the ~~Dreamcube Handbook~~
